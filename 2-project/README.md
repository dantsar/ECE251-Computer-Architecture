# Second Project: Sort

Goal is to read a file of 32bit ints on each line, with at most 100 lines, and sort it. 

The proj2.S is modeled after sort.c
The input file is assumed to be "unsorted_list" and it is in the same directory as the executable. The program will create a file called sorted_list that will contain the sorted contents

genlist.c was used to generate at list of random 32bit integers
